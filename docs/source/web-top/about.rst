Sometimes you just need to log in to your web server and see what's going on.
`web-top` allows you to do. Instead of focusing Application Performance Management (APM),
metrics or log storage `web-top` displays what's currently happening in your web server.
`web-top` is ideal for observing and catching issues when they happen.
